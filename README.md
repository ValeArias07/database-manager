On this page he welcomes us to the software and gives us two options. From where we can choose "Generate new data" or "Load data"

**Generate new data:**

In this screen it gives us the possibility to write the number of people we want to create in our database. It also shows us the elapsed time by means of a progress bar. In addition, it also shows how long the lead generation process takes.

**Load data:**

![LoadData](https://github.com/ValeArias07/database-manager/blob/master/src/images/load%20data.png)

This screen gives us a menu where we will find "File" and "Actions". "File" is used to save the data. "Actions" is the one that contains the CRUD operations.

**CRUD operations(Actions):**

- _ADD:_ on this page we have all the required fields (except the code) to fill them in and you have the option to save.
